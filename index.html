    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the <b>reason for the hope</b> that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect</p>
	<p class="small-text">The First Epistle of St. Peter, Chapter 3, Verse 15.</p>
	<p> This verse outlines the core mission of Reason For Hope Apologetics.</p>
	<p>
  In today's rapidly changing world, it has become more important than ever to be able to answer the questions people have.  
  Questions such as 'Does God exist?' 'Did Jesus really rise from the dead?'  
  These questions can be answered rationally and with precision. Gone are the days where you are asked to believe in
  things just by pure speculation.
