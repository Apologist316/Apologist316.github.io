        <p>But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the <b>reason for the hope</b> that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect</p>
        <p class="small-text">The First Epistle of St. Peter, Chapter 3, Verse 15.</p>
        <p>This verse outlines the core mission of Reason For Hope Apologetics.</p>
        <p>
        In today's rapidly changing world, it has become more important than ever to be able to answer the questions people have.
        Questions such as 'Does God exist?' 'Did Jesus really rise from the dead?'
        These questions can be answered rationally and with precision. Gone are the days where you are asked to believe in
        things just by pure speculation. But how does one go about answering these questions? It begins with equipping yourself with the rich knowledge within the Christian Tradition that had been in existence for over 2000 years.
        Saints and Scholars, through the power of the Holy Spirit have already sought to answer these questions and therefore we too will find them when we look into their works.
        </p>
        <p>Reason of Hope aims to provide you the necessary insights to not only defend your faith but also learn to appreciate the scholastic work that is present within Christianity.</p>
