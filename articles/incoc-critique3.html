                <p>
                    One common objection I have to my position of being against re-baptism is the question of whether if the Baptism of Infants is valid.
                    As it has been previously established that Christ died once, for all and there is a clear connection between the Crucifixion of Christ and Baptism, as stated by the Apostles, therefore
                    it can be concluded that partaking in the act of rebaptism, is to put Christ on the Cross again, which is an insult to His finished work, even in the case of infants, who were baptised
                    by the consent of their parents. As stated earlier, even the act of Baptism is tied to the Covenant of Circumcision in the Old Testament. A person once circumcised cannot be circumcised
                    again, in the same way Christ's sacrifice is once for all. 
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>“<sup>11</sup> In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. 
                        Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ, <sup>12</sup>  having been buried with him in baptism,
                        in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.  
                    <br><strong>Colossians 2:11-12</strong></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Now here are some more verses that throw a wrench into the whole idea that infants shouldn't be baptised.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        <sup>38</sup>  Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. 
                        And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
                        <sup>39</sup>  The promise is for you and <strong>your children</strong> and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call. 
                        <br><strong>Acts 2:38-39</strong>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    'The promise is for you and your children' why would St. Peter say this if the Holy Spirit was to be received only by the believers? 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” <sup>2</sup> He called a child, whom he put among them, 
                        <sup>3</sup> and said, <strong>“Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children</strong>, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 
                        <sup>4</sup> Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
                        <sup>5</sup> Whoever welcomes <strong>one such child in my name welcomes me.</strong>
                        <sup>6</sup> “If any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me, 
                        it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea.
                        <sup>10</sup> “Take care that <strong>you do not despise one of these little ones; 
                        for, I tell you, in heaven their angels continually see the face of my Father in heaven.</strong>
                        <sup>14</sup> So it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.
                        <br><strong>Matthew 18:1-6;10,14</strong>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        <sup>13</sup> People were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them; and the disciples spoke sternly to them. 
                        <sup>14</sup> But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, <strong>“Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; 
                        for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs.</strong>
                        <sup>15</sup> Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.” 
                        <sup>16</sup> And he took them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.
                        <br><strong>Mark 10:13-16</strong>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>

                <p>
                    All three Synoptic Gospels record this incident and it serves to remind that the Kingdom of God even belongs to little children as well.
                    Jesus goes as far as saying that if anyone causes a child to sin is better off drowning in the ocean. This is why the Early Church wanted
                    infants and children to be baptised, because the Lord was clearly commanding that they too be included in the plan of Salvation.
                    Entire households too used to be baptised as referenced in the Acts of The Apostles. Therefore tying Baptism to the New Covenant one must
                    have to conclude that Baptism, being a necessary part of Salvation, must be given to all those who are included in it, especially infants and children.

                <p>
                    Now that we know what the Bible has to say about the Sacrament of Baptism, let us now see what the 
                    Early Church taught on this as well. Contrary to what most Evangelicals believe, the Early Church Fathers
                    were mostly of the same opinion on the Sacrament of Baptism. Let us look at some examples.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        And concerning baptism, baptize this way: Having first said all these things, baptize into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, in living water. 
                        But if you have not living water, baptize into other water; and if you can not in cold, in warm. 
                        But if you have not either, pour out water thrice upon the head into the name of Father and Son and Holy Spirit. 
                        But before the baptism let the baptizer fast, and the baptized, and whatever others can; 
                        but you shall order the baptized to fast one or two days before.
                        <br><strong>The Didache Ch.7</strong>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The Didache was an Early Christian work written around 100 AD, within the lifetime of the Apostles. Here we can see clear instructions 
                    on how one is to be baptised. This goes against what some people argue for Re-Baptism, that only full immersion Baptism is a valid form 
                    of Baptism. The Didache clearly states that as long as water was used in the Baptism and the name of The Trinity was invoked, the Baptism
                    is valid. The idea that Baptism needs to be done through full immersion in water is a much later tradition that was promoted by the Particular 
                    Baptist Tradition of the early 1600s.

                        “He [Jesus] came to save all through himself; all, I say, who through him are reborn in God: infants, and children, and youths, and old men. 
                        Therefore he passed through every age, becoming an infant for infants, sanctifying infants; a child for children, sanctifying those who are of that age . . . 
                        [so that] he might be the perfect teacher in all things, perfect not only in respect to the setting forth of truth, perfect also in respect to relative age”

                        In the Church, baptism is given for the remission of sins, and, according to the usage of the Church, baptism is given even to infants. 
                        If there were nothing in infants which required the remission of sins and nothing in them pertinent to forgiveness, 
                        the grace of baptism would seem superfluous”

                        “The Church received from the apostles the tradition of giving baptism even to infants. 
                        The apostles, to whom were committed the secrets of the divine sacraments, 
                        knew there are in everyone innate strains of [original] sin, which must be washed away through water and the Spirit”

                        “As to what pertains to the case of infants: You [Fidus] said that they ought not to be baptized within the second or third day after their birth, 
                        that the old law of circumcision must be taken into consideration, 
                        and that you did not think that one should be baptized and sanctified within the eighth day after his birth. 
                        In our council it seemed to us far otherwise. No one agreed to the course which you thought should be taken. 
                        Rather, we all judge that the mercy and grace of God ought to be denied to no man born”
                        <br>“If, in the case of the worst sinners and those who formerly sinned much against God, when afterwards they believe, 
                        the remission of their sins is granted and no one is held back from baptism and grace, how much more, then, 
                        should an infant not be held back, who, having but recently been born, has done no sin, except that, 
                        born of the flesh according to Adam, he has contracted the contagion of that old death from his first being born. 
                        For this very reason does he [an infant] approach more easily to receive the remission of sins: 
                        because the sins forgiven him are not his own but those of another”

                <p>
                    So now that we've established that the Early Church was not at all opposed to the baptism of infants and heretics, 
                    and that the same can be demonstrated in Scripture, it must be noted the act of rebaptism constitutes a grevious sin
                    against the Holy Spirit. This is because the Holy Spirit is taking part in the Baptism on behalf of Christ. The Early 
                    Church was unianimous in calling the act of rebaptism a sin. When the act of Baptism has been deeply connected to Regeneration
                    why is there an insistence that one ought to go through with it? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objection 1:</strong> What if Baptism isnt given in the correct form?
                    <br><strong>Response:</strong> The correct form of Baptism is the use of the Trinitarian Formula: "In the name of the Father, the Son and
                    the Holy Spirit.." The Trinity must be invoked no matter what. If not the person must be given proper baptism.</li>
                    <li><strong>Objection 2:</strong> What about those baptised in the Mormon, Jehovah's Witnesses, Bible Students, Oneness Pentecostals Cults?
                    <br><strong>Response:</strong> These individuals must undergo baptism in the Trinitarian Formula. These cults do not profess the Triune God
                    and they must be treated as unbelievers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Objection 3:</strong> What if the individual doesn't "feel" their first baptism was valid or wants to "undergo baptism properly?"
                    <br><strong>Response:</strong> If the baptism has been given in the Trinitarian formula then it is valid, our feelings do not validate the efficacy
                    of baptism, because it is the work of God. Just because we do not see God or feel His Presence everyday that doesn't mean He is not with us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Objection 4:</strong> What if water was poured on my head? Is that a valid form of baptism?
                    <br><strong>Response:</strong> The Early Church in the first century and later baptised in that manner so it is valid.
                    </ul>

                    If there are more objections that i come across, I will update this list.
