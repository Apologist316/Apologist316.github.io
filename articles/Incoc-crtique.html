                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, I am not here to critique the history of the International Churches of Christ (which is a whole another can of worms that I do not wish to open), nor its members, but rather its theology. It must be noted that I have immense respect for certain members of the International Churches of Christ here in India. My first introduction to God was in this church, my first friends were made in this church, my first exposure to the world was in this church. I have seen God move in the lives of the people in this church and I have seen how Christ has changed people in this church for the better.
                    However, after several years of being challenged in my faith and gaining deeper insights into Holy Scriptures and Sacred Traditions of the Apostolic Church, I have begun to see the holes in the teachings of INCOC. 
                <p>
                    Inconsistency and Misrepresentation of several historic teachings are being used to justify the theology of this church. I wish to draw closer to God in my life and seek Him more deeply, but the prevalence of these teachings hinders thus journey.
                    Knowing the history of INCOC and its leadership style, I do know for a fact that any attempt to “reform” or to “establish sound doctrine” will lead to me receiving severe backlash.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    This confusion on the question of theology began when I was baptized into the Catholic Church in 2019 due to my parents’ desire for me to study in a Catholic School. Now, despite being baptized without being given a choice, I decided to accept it as I strongly believed that God was in control of my life and that He wouldn’t let me be led astray. What followed were six years of trials and temptations. I became agnostic and began to question the relevancy of my faith and whether it was worth continuing having it. But praise be to God, He never did let me be lead astray. It was at this moment where friends and leaders of INCOC helped me find my faith and make it have a solid foundation. It was also around this time where I began to deeply study Theology, which opened the door to a much more beautiful relationship with God. 
                    But as I continued to grow in my relationship and knowledge of God, I began to the see inconsistencies in the doctrines that were being taught in the INCOC. I put it off for the longest time by telling myself that maybe I do not know enough yet or that as long as I’m coming to Christ, that’s more than enough, but deep down I did feel a void in my soul. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, there was an insistence by certain leaders that I get ‘re-baptized’ as the ‘way’ in which baptisms are carried out in the Catholic Church (the pouring of water on the head, known as “Trine Baptism”) was not valid and is nowhere to be found in Scripture. Because of this, I wasn’t considered to be a ‘member’ of INCOC. Coupled with the fact that I was staying far away from home at that time (during my undergraduate years), I began to feel a sense of detachment from the INCOC. The final nail in the coffin came in the beginning of 2025 where after speaking with leaders more on the issue of the validity of my baptism, I became clear that they would not recognize it and as long as I do not undergo ‘re-baptism’ I would never be considered a full-time member. 
                    Even after I made my case using Early Church History, it was rejected as it was “not in Scripture” making me question whether these leaders seriously believe that the Early Christians practiced the wrong form of Christianity until Kip McKean came along in the 1960s to fix it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless, after putting it off for months and after careful consideration and deep meditation I decided to go back to the Catholic Church and leave INCOC for good (I was never even a member there anyways to begin with.) 
                    Now the reason why I am writing this document is this, I want my friends in the INCOC to know that they have been led to misunderstand Scripture. I love them dearly and they deserve to know the truth of their faith. They have been fed a diluted form of Christianity and have been conditioned to seek God only through their ‘personal experiences’ rather than in the Sacraments which He has ordained for us. I know I will ruffle feathers with this, but my conscience is clear, I seek that my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ come to a full knowledge of our faith and in doing so, have a better relationship with Him.
