                <h2>Chapter One: Introduction to Baptism</h2>
                <p>
                    How does Scripture define baptism? It is important for us to define terms before we begin to discuss any topic. 
                    Here are some verses from the Gospels where Jesus speaks about Baptism.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>“Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.”  
                    <br><strong>Mark 16:16</strong></p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. 
                        Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. 
                        You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’ 8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. 
                        You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. 
                        So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.” 
                        <br><strong> John 3:5–8</strong>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    In the Gospel of St. Mark, Jesus spells it out quite clearly and frankly that if you hear the gospel and believe, 
                    you need to be baptized in order to be saved. Notice how Jesus doubles down in His conversation with Nicodemus in 
                    the Gospel of St. John using the phrase “Very truly.” Every time Jesus uses this phrase in the Gospel of St. John, He is 
                    emphasizing a truth that challenges common assumptions. The statement regarding rebirth by water and Spirit 
                    is therefore of deep theological seriousness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Apostles too stressed the importance of baptism:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. 
                        It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ 
                        <br><strong>1 Peter 3:21</strong>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    In this verse, St. Peter says that the waters of baptism do not only merely serve the 
                    purpose of washing away dirt but also is a solemn pledge to God and ties you to the Resurrection of Jesus. 
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        “Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?...”  
                        <br><strong>Romans 6:3–4</strong>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    St. Paul clearly connects the death of Jesus to baptism. 
                    He also adds that we receive a new life through baptism. 
                    It’s no mere action that we have been commanded to peform because it was commanded by Jesus, rather it also the beginning of a new life. 
                    This isn’t something that can be dismissed as merely symbolic. 
                    How can mere water wash away sins and offer us a new life? 
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        “For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.”  
                        <br><strong>Galatians 3:27</strong>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Note how St. Paul ties baptism to circumcision as well. 
                    The “circumcision” performed by Christ is to make us like Him (as stated in the earlier verses) and you are being buried with Him in death by baptism. 
                    Therefore, it can be said that in the process of becoming Christ-like, Baptism is an important step.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. 
                        Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ, 
                        having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, 
                        who raised him from the dead.  
                        <br><strong>Colossians 2:11–12</strong>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                    
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, 
                        slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.  
                        <br><strong>1 Corinthians 12:13</strong>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Baptism is also tied to the Holy Spirit, by saying that it is Holy Spirit that performs the Baptism. 
                    This is because He is the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity and works through us to make people conform to Christ. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>From these verses we conclude:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Baptism is how we are saved.</li>
                    <li>Baptism gives us new life.</li>
                    <li>Baptism unites us to Christ’s Death and Resurrection.</li>
                    <li>Baptism incorporates us into the Church by the Holy Spirit.</li>
                    <li>Baptism is the work of God, not merely symbolic.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    From Scripture alone, baptism is not presented as mere symbolism, but as the ordinary means by which God grants grace.

                <h2>Chapter Two: One Baptism for All</h2>

                <p>
                    In this chapter we shall deal with the question, Is it okay to rebaptize people? 
                    As shown in the previous chapter, Baptism is no mere human work, rather it is a command ordained by Christ Himself for the purpose of bringing people to God’s Kingdom. 
                    Other verses from Scripture also indicate that Baptism is what enables us to receive the Holy Spirit and ties us to 
                    the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. 
                    It is the means by which we are given a new life as well. So, taking all these points into consideration, 
                    one must conclude that there is definitely a mystical element to Baptism, 
                    that the Apostles stressed on.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; 
                        one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. 
                        <br><strong>Ephesians 4:21</strong>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    In this verse, St. Paul says that just as how we are a singular body (The Church) and have a singular faith, we also have a singular baptism, 
                    just as how we have a singular God (in being, not in personage). St. Paul in this chapter is urging the Ephesians to maintain the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
                    which is also singular. The Holy Spirit cannot be divided, just as how The Church cannot be divided. 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                    For Christ also <strong>suffered once for sins</strong>, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. 
                    He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. After being made alive, 
                    he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits— to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. 
                    In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, 
                    and this <strong>water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. 
                    It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</strong> who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.
                    <br><strong>1 Peter 3: 18-22</strong>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The reason why I have quoted this verse again along with the verses that precede it is because of v.18 where St. Peter clearly affirms that Jesus suffered ONCE for all to bring us to God. 
                    As demonstrated in the previous chapter, Baptism and the Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ are clearly tied together. 
                    So, what does this mean for rebaptism? Since there is a clear connection between the death and resurrection of Jesus and baptism, 
                    as demonstrated in Holy Scripture, that would mean to crucify Christ again. Baptism, given at any stage of life is valid because 
                    the death and resurrection of Jesus is for all people, for all time. St. Paul reiterates this in Romans 6. 

                </p>

                <blockquote>
                        <p>
                        We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? 
                        Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 
                        <strong>We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, 
                        just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. 
                        For we know that <strong>our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, 
                        that we should no longer be slaves to sin</strong>— because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 
                        For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. 
                        The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.
                        <br><strong>Romans 6:2-8</strong>
                        </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Rebaptism is clearly unbiblical as Jesus died once for all and baptism that ties us to it is a seal that is done once.
                    In the next part we will be going over some common objections to this teaching.
